// This file can be deleted if no longer used for Firebase specific initializations
// other than authentication (which is now handled by Auth0).
// If you have other Firebase services (e.g., Firestore, Storage directly, not via Admin SDK),
// you might keep this. For now, assuming it was primarily for Firebase Auth.
// If it's not used, it's best to remove it to avoid confusion.
// For this change, I will mark it as empty, suggesting deletion if not needed.
